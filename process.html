    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
        Our engineering project focused on building a cross-disciplinary <strong>vending machine</strong> that addresses the lack of healthy snack access on campus, especially during off-hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process began with <strong>design brainstorming and team role assignments</strong>, followed by ordering essential components like servo motors, polycarbonate sheets, and Arduino boards. We <strong>constructed a durable frame</strong> with modular polycarbonate panels, integrated a <strong>spiral spring dispensing system</strong> powered by high-torque servos, and assembled the internal circuitry.
    </p>
    <p>
        We built a <strong>membrane keypad interface</strong> for user selection and connected it to an <strong>Arduino Mega 2560</strong>, which controls servo motion, sensors, and LED feedback. An <strong>IR sensor</strong> ensures successful item dispensing, and a toggle switch allows for convenient reloading.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project involved extensive <strong>software development</strong>, implementing real-time keypad input, automatic retry logic, and inventory tracking with LED alerts. We documented our findings, created a demo video, and launched a portfolio website to showcase our progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        This experience provided valuable lessons in system integration, project management, and multi-disciplinary collaborationâ€”mirroring real-world engineering challenges.
